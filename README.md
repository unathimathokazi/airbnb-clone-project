| **Listing Detailed View**  | When a user clicks on a property, they will be taken to this page, which includes detailed descriptions, high-quality images, reviews, pricing details, and a booking option. |

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System
A user-friendly design is crucial in any booking system because it ensures users can easily find what they need and complete their bookings without confusion or frustration. The booking process should be smooth and intuitive, with minimal steps required to confirm the reservation. Clear visual hierarchy, easy-to-use forms, and well-organized content are essential for providing a pleasant user experience and encouraging conversions (i.e., bookings). Furthermore, making the system accessible to all users ensures inclusivity, which is important for customer satisfaction.
